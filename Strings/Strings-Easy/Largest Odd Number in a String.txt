Largest Odd Number in a String

Problem Statement: Given a string s, representing a large integer, the task is to return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a substring of the given string s.
The number returned should not have leading zero's. But the given input string may have leading zero.

Example 1
Input: s = "5347"
Output: "5347"
Explanation: The odd numbers formed by the given string are → 5, 3, 53, 347, 5347. The largest odd number without leading zeroes is 5347.

Example 2
Input: s = "0214638"
Output: "21463"
Explanation: The odd numbers formed by the string are → 1, 3, 21, 63, 463, 1463, 21463. We can't use numbers starting with 0, so the largest valid odd number is 21463.

Algorithm
Focus on finding the longest valid odd number starting from the original string.
An odd number must end with an odd digit, so we look for the last odd digit when scanning from the end.
Leading zeroes don’t add value to the number, so we aim to remove them for a cleaner representation.
Once the endpoint (last odd digit) is determined, we identify the starting point by skipping any leading zeroes before it.
Extract the portion between these two positions, this gives the largest possible odd integer from the string.

Code:-

class Solution {
    public String largestOddNumber(String num) {
        int ind = -1;
        int i;
        for (i = num.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if ((num.charAt(i) - '0') % 2 == 1) {
                ind = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (ind == -1) return "";
        i = 0;
        while (i <= ind && num.charAt(i) == '0') i++;
        return num.substring(i, ind + 1);
    }
}
