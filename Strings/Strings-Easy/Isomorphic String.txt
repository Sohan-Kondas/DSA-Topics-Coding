Isomorphic String

Problem Statement: Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
Example 1
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters in "s" can be mapped one-to-one to characters in "t": 
'p' → 't', 'a' → 'i', 'e' → 'l', 'r' → 'e'
Since the mapping is consistent and unique for each character, the strings are isomorphic.

Example 2
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Explanation: 'f' → 'b' is fine, 'o' → 'a' for the first 'o', But the second 'o' in "s" would need to map to 'r' in "t", which conflicts with the earlier mapping of 'o' → 'a'
This inconsistency makes it impossible to convert "s" to "t" using a one-to-one character mapping.

Algorithm
Think of isomorphism as a consistent one-to-one mapping between characters of two strings.
The goal is to ensure the pattern of appearances and repetitions is identical in both strings.
Use two fixed-size arrays (size 256) to track the last-seen positions of characters from each string.
While scanning both strings together, compare if the characters at the current position have been seen at the same relative positions before.
If not, it indicates inconsistent mapping — one character maps to multiple others — return false.
If consistent, update the last seen position of both characters to ensure future checks remain valid.
This approach confirms isomorphic structure by comparing character occurrence patterns, not the characters themselves.

Code:-
class Solution {
      // Method to check if two strings are isomorphic
      public boolean isomorphicString(String s, String t) {
          // Arrays to track last seen positions of characters in s and t
          int[] m1 = new int[256], m2 = new int[256];
  
          // Get length of the strings
          int n = s.length();
  
          // Loop through all characters in the strings
          for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
              // Return false if mapping is inconsistent
              if (m1[s.charAt(i)] != m2[t.charAt(i)]) return false;
  
              // Update last seen index for both characters
              m1[s.charAt(i)] = i + 1;
              m2[t.charAt(i)] = i + 1;
          }
  
          // Return true if all character mappings are consistent
          return true;
      }
}
