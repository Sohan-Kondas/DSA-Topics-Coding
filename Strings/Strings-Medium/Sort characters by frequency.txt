Sort characters by frequency

Problem Statement: You are given a string s. Return the array of unique characters, sorted by highest to lowest occurring characters.
If two or more characters have same frequency then arrange them in alphabetic order.

Example 1:
Input: s = "tree"
Output: ['e', 'r', 't']
Explanation:
e → 2
r → 1
t → 1
Since 'r' and 't' have the same frequency, they are sorted alphabetically → 'r' comes before 't'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "raaaajj"
Output: ['a', 'j', 'r']
Explanation:
a → 4
j → 2
r → 1
Characters are sorted by decreasing frequency. In case of ties, alphabetically.

Algorithm
The goal is to rank characters based on how frequently they appear in the string.
We need a structure that can track both the character and how often it occurs.
Sorting the characters by frequency helps surface the most significant ones first.
To maintain consistency when frequencies match, tie-breaking is done alphabetically.
Once sorted, the characters with non-zero occurrences form the final ranked result.

    // Method to sort characters by frequency
    public List<Character> frequencySort(String s) {
        // Array to hold frequency and character for 'a' to 'z'
        Pair[] freq = new Pair[26];
        
        // Initialize the frequency array
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            freq[i] = new Pair(0, (char)(i + 'a'));
        }

        // Count frequency of each character in the string
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[ch - 'a'].freq++;
        }

        // Sort array by frequency descending, then by character ascending
        Arrays.sort(freq, (p1, p2) -> {
            if (p1.freq != p2.freq) return p2.freq - p1.freq;
            return p1.ch - p2.ch;
        });

        // Collect characters with non-zero frequency into result list
        List<Character> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Pair p : freq) {
            if (p.freq > 0) result.add(p.ch);
        }

        // Return the final list
        return result;
    }

    // Inner class to store frequency and character
    class Pair {
        int freq;
        char ch;
        Pair(int f, char c) {
            this.freq = f;
            this.ch = c;

Time Complexity: O(n + k log k), where n is the length of the string and k is the constant 26 for the alphabet.

Space Complexity: O(k) , where k is the constant 26 for the frequency array.
