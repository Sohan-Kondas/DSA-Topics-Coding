Roman Numerals to Integer

Problem Statement: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000
For example: 2 is written as II, 12 is written as XII, 27 is written as XXVII.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. But in six special cases, subtraction is used instead of addition:
I before V or X → 4 and 9,
X before L or C → 40 and 90,
C before D or M → 400 and 900
Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Algorithm
Understand that Roman numerals are generally written in descending order of value, and their values are added.
However, when a smaller value appears before a larger one, it indicates subtraction instead of addition.
To handle this, scan the string from left to right and compare each character with the one after it.
If the current symbol is smaller than the next, treat it as a subtractive pair.
Otherwise, treat the symbol as a standalone value and add it normally.
The final character is always added since there's nothing after it to compare.

                res -= roman.get(s.charAt(i));
