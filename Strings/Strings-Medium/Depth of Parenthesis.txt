Depth of Parenthesis
Algorithm
We're interested in measuring how deeply nested the parentheses are at any point in the string.
Each opening bracket indicates going deeper into a new level of nesting.
Each closing bracket signals returning to the previous level of nesting.
By tracking how deep we go at each step, we can monitor the peak nesting level.
The deepest level we reach during this traversal is the answer.

class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(String s) {
        int p = 0; 
        int ans = 0; 
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '(') p++;
            else if (ch == ')') p--;
            ans = Math.max(ans, p);
        }
        return ans; 
    }
}
