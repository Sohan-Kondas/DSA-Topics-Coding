Sum of beauty of substring
Problem Statement: The beauty of a string is defined as the difference between the frequency of the most frequent character and the least frequent character (excluding characters that do not appear) in that string.

Given a string s, return the sum of beauty values of all possible substrings of s.

Example 1:
Input: s = "xyx"
Output: 1
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are:
"xyx" → frequencies: x:2, y:1 → beauty = 2 - 1 = 1
"xy" → x:1, y:1 → beauty = 0
"yx" → y:1, x:1 → beauty = 0
"x" or "y" → beauty = 0
Total sum = 1 (from "xyx") = 1

Example 2:
Input: s = "aabcbaa"
Output: 17
Explanation: Various substrings such as "aabc", "bcba", etc., have non-zero beauty values. Summing all gives 17.

Algorithm
Loop through all substrings of the string.
Maintain a frequency map of characters for each substring.
For each substring:
Find the most frequent character's count.
Find the least frequent non-zero character's count.
Calculate the difference between the two counts.
Add the difference to the running sum.

class Solution {
    public int beautySum(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int sum = 0;

        // Loop through all substrings
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                // Increase character frequency
                freq.put(s.charAt(j), freq.getOrDefault(s.charAt(j), 0) + 1);

                int maxi = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                int mini = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

                // Calculate max and min frequency
                for (int val : freq.values()) {
                    mini = Math.min(mini, val);
                    maxi = Math.max(maxi, val);
                }

                // Add to sum
                sum += (maxi - mini);
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
}

Time Complexity:

Outer loop: O(n) (for each starting index)
Inner loop: O(n) (for each ending index)
Computing max and min for frequencies: O(26) in the worst case (since only lowercase letters), O(n^2 * 26) ≈ O(n^2) because 26 is constant.

Space Complexity:
Frequency map uses at most 26 characters → O(26) = O(1).
No extra data structures apart from that.
