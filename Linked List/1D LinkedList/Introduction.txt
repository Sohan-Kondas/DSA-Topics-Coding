Let's break this example to understand how it works:

The struct has two data types: data which contains the value of the node and a pointer next, which points to the next node in the list.
There is a constructor which assigns the values to a new node.
A new keyword is used to dynamically allocate memory to a node with data as arr[0].
The combination of the given parameters and functions initializes a linked list.

Understanding Pointers
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. In simpler terms, it "points" to the location in memory where data is stored. This allows you to indirectly access and manipulate data by referring to its memory address.

Java does not explicitly use pointers or take the address of variables as you do in C++. Instead, we have reference variables. These reference variables do not directly contain memory addresses like pointers in languages such as C or C++. Instead, they hold references to objects in memory.

Understanding the difference between Node and Node*: A node refers to the structure that contains data and the pointer to the next node. In contrast, Node* (Node pointer) specifically denotes a pointer variable that stores the address of the Node it is pointing to.

Memory Space:
Assuming the data stored is integer. Another main difference between an array and a linked list is the memory used. In the case of an array, we are storing integers that consume 4 Bytes for every int, whereas in a linked list, we are storing data and a pointer at every node, so the memory used up will depend on the configuration of the system.

32 Bit System	        64 Bit System
Int - 4 Bytes	        Int - 4 Bytes
Pointer - 4 Bytes	Pointer - 8 Bytes
Overall - 8 Bytes	Overall - 12 Bytes
Therefore, in the case of a 64 Bit system, it occupies or consumes more space than a 32 Bit system.

Applications of Linked Lists:

Creating Data Structures: Linked lists serve as the foundation for building other dynamic data structures, such as stacks and queues.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation relies on linked lists to manage and allocate memory blocks efficiently.
Web Browser is one important application of Linked List.

class Node {
    public:
        int data;         // Data stored in the node
        Node* next;       // Pointer to the next node in the linked list
        // Constructors
        Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
            data = data1;
            next = next1;
        }
        // Constructor
        Node(int data1) {
            data = data1;
            next = nullptr;
        }
};
int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {2, 5, 8, 7};
    // Create a Node 'x' with the first element of the vector and a null next reference
    Node x = Node(arr[0], nullptr);
    // Create a pointer 'y' pointing to the Node 'x'
    Node* y = &x;
    // Print the memory address of the Node 'x' using the pointer 'y'
    cout << y << '\n';
